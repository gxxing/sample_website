  <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>
   <p>
    Leaarn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach technical sophistication, the seemingly majical ability to take command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts and Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing. We believe there are at least a bilion people who can benefi fom learning technical sophistication probably more. To join our movement, sing up for our official email list now.
